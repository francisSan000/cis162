<p>Hello, I am Francisco Sanchez, a college student that wishes to learn coding. I have always wished to start learning code but never knew where to start. Leaving in a household of five I have been the one that my family has relied on with the basics of technology and that sparked a want to learn more and more about it. Iâ€™m a relatively quiet person that enjoyed peace and serenity more than most and also found the clicking of a keyboard sound relaxing so it made sense that I would try to start with coding and software rather than hardware
